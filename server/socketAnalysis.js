console.log('🔍 SOCKET IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS');
console.log('=' .repeat(50));

console.log('\n📊 CURRENT SOCKET IMPLEMENTATION:');
console.log('✅ Socket.IO server is running and accepting connections');
console.log('✅ Basic socket events are working (joinGroup, joinList, listUpdate)');
console.log('✅ CORS is configured to allow all origins');

console.log('\n🔍 POTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:');

console.log('\n1. 🏠 ROOM MANAGEMENT ISSUES:');
console.log('   ❌ Problem: Socket rooms use groupId as room name, but list updates may not reach all group members');
console.log('   ❌ Issue: When a user joins a group, they join the groupId room, but list updates are emitted to listId room');
console.log('   ❌ Issue: No verification that users are actually group members before joining rooms');
console.log('   💡 Solution: Ensure users join both groupId and listId rooms, and verify membership');

console.log('\n2. 📡 CLIENT-SIDE SOCKET CONNECTION:');
console.log('   ❌ Problem: Client connects to hardcoded IP: http://172.20.10.6:5000');
console.log('   ❌ Issue: If server IP changes, client won\'t connect');
console.log('   ❌ Issue: No reconnection logic or error handling');
console.log('   💡 Solution: Use environment variables and add reconnection logic');

console.log('\n3. 🔄 REAL-TIME UPDATE FLOW:');
console.log('   ❌ Problem: listUpdate events are emitted but may not reach all group members');
console.log('   ❌ Issue: Room joining happens on client, but server doesn\'t verify group membership');
console.log('   ❌ Issue: No error handling for failed socket operations');
console.log('   💡 Solution: Verify group membership on server before allowing room joins');

console.log('\n4. 🎯 SPECIFIC GROUP SYSTEM ISSUES:');
console.log('   ❌ Problem: When adding items to group shared list, socket updates may not work');
console.log('   ❌ Issue: Group members may not receive real-time updates when others add items');
console.log('   ❌ Issue: No confirmation that socket events are reaching all group members');
console.log('   💡 Solution: Add proper room management and verification');

console.log('\n🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES:');

console.log('\n1. 🏠 IMPROVE ROOM MANAGEMENT:');
console.log('   - Verify group membership before allowing room joins');
console.log('   - Join both groupId and listId rooms for comprehensive updates');
console.log('   - Add room cleanup when users leave groups');

console.log('\n2. 📱 IMPROVE CLIENT CONNECTION:');
console.log('   - Use environment variables for socket URL');
console.log('   - Add reconnection logic and error handling');
console.log('   - Add connection status indicators');

console.log('\n3. 🔄 ENHANCE REAL-TIME UPDATES:');
console.log('   - Add proper error handling for socket operations');
console.log('   - Implement retry logic for failed updates');
console.log('   - Add logging to track socket event flow');

console.log('\n4. 🎯 FIX GROUP SYSTEM:');
console.log('   - Ensure all group members receive list updates');
console.log('   - Add proper room management for group lists');
console.log('   - Implement member verification for socket operations');

console.log('\n🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:');
console.log('1. Fix room management in server.js');
console.log('2. Update client socket connection to use environment variables');
console.log('3. Add proper group membership verification');
console.log('4. Test real-time updates with multiple group members');

console.log('\n📋 TESTING CHECKLIST:');
console.log('✅ Socket connection works');
console.log('❌ Group room joining needs verification');
console.log('❌ List updates need proper room management');
console.log('❌ Client reconnection logic needed');
console.log('❌ Error handling for socket operations needed');

console.log('\n🎯 CONCLUSION:');
console.log('The socket infrastructure is working, but the group system real-time updates');
console.log('are likely failing due to improper room management and lack of group');
console.log('membership verification. This explains why group members don\'t see');
console.log('real-time updates when others add items to the shared list.');
