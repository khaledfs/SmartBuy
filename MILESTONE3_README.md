3. **FAVORITE**: Items with highest purchase frequency
4. **ALL**: Complete product catalog

## 📊 Data Structure

### Products
- 200+ products from `products.json`
- Categories: Dairy, Produce, Meat, Pantry, Beverages, Snacks, etc.
- Realistic pricing and availability

### Households
- 100+ simulated households
- 1-4 members per household
- Realistic names and contact information
- Group-based shopping coordination

### Purchase History
- 50,000+ purchase records
- 50-80 shopping trips per household
- 2 years of historical data
- Seasonal shopping patterns included
- Realistic quantities and pricing

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Node.js installed
- Smart Buy app codebase

### Step 1: Configure Database
1. Get your MongoDB Atlas connection string
2. Open `server/scripts/seedMilestone3Data.js`
3. Replace the `MONGODB_URI` with your connection string:
   ```javascript
   const MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@your-cluster.mongodb.net/smartbuy?retryWrites=true&w=majority';
   ```

### Step 2: Run Setup Check
```bash
cd Smart_Buy/server
node scripts/setupMilestone3.js
```

### Step 3: Seed the Database
```bash
cd Smart_Buy/server
node scripts/seedMilestone3Data.js
```

### Step 4: Start the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start server
cd Smart_Buy/server
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Start client
cd Smart_Buy/client
npm start
```

## 🎯 Testing the Smart Predictions

### 1. Login to the App
- Use any of the seeded user accounts
- Example: `john0`, `jane1`, `mike2` (password: `password123`)

### 2. Navigate to Smart Suggestions
- Go to the Smart Suggestions screen
- You should see all 4 cards populated with data

### 3. Test Each Card
- **ALL**: Shows all available products
- **FREQUENT**: Shows items most bought by your household
- **RECENT**: Shows your recent purchases
- **FAVORITE**: Shows your most frequently bought items

## 📈 ML Algorithm Details

### Data Sources
- **User Purchase History**: Individual shopping patterns
- **Household Patterns**: Group shopping behavior
- **Global Trends**: Popular items across all users
- **Seasonal Data**: Time-based shopping patterns

### Feature Extraction
- Purchase frequency analysis
- Product association learning
- Seasonal trend detection
- Household size correlation
- Price sensitivity patterns

### Ranking Algorithm
1. **Personal Relevance**: User's own purchase history
2. **Household Patterns**: Family shopping behavior
3. **Global Popularity**: Overall product popularity
4. **Seasonal Relevance**: Current time period patterns
5. **Price Optimization**: Cost-effective alternatives

## 🔧 For Client Testing

### Independent Setup
1. Client gets their own MongoDB Atlas account
2. Client uses their own connection string
3. Client runs the same seeding script
4. Both parties can test independently

### Demo Instructions
1. Show the seeding process (takes 2-3 minutes)
2. Demonstrate smart suggestions working
3. Show different household accounts
4. Explain the ML features implemented
5. Show seasonal pattern recognition

## 📋 Milestone 3 Deliverables

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Refused**: Check Atlas connection string
2. **Products Not Loading**: Ensure `products.json` exists in scripts folder
3. **Empty Suggestions**: Run the seeding script completely
4. **Server Errors**: Check MongoDB connection and restart server

### Support
